When we were working on the assignment, we were not aware of the need to 
switch off on the committing when we were pair programming (or that we needed
to commit with each switch). We cooperatively worked at pair programming,
copying down the code and checking each other for any possible slip-ups in 
syntax. Swaps were in about 20-25 minute intervals.
